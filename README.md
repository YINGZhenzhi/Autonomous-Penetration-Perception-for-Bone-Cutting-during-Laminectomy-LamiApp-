# Autonomous-Penetration-Perception-for-Bone-Cutting-during-Laminectomy-LamiApp

In spinal surgery, the surgeon needs superb skills 
to  determine  the  extent  of  penetration  of  cutting  tool  for 
preventing  the  damage  of  nerves  or  organs.  Thus,  a  cutting 
system  with  autonomous  penetration  detection  would 
drastically improve the safety and efficiency of surgery. In this 
study,  a  hand-hold  bone  cutting  system  for  laminectomy  with 
on-line autonomous penetration perception of bone is presented. 
Since  the  penetration  during  operation  process  is  invisible,  a 
practical  surgeon  uses  force  feedback  and  sound  to  perceive 
cutting  state.  Inspired  by  that,  the  proposed  system was 
designed  to  recognize  different  cutting  states  by  measured 
cutting force and sound signals. A radial basis function neural 
network was employed to classify different bone cutting states.
Results of cross validation prove that the accuracy of perception 
system reaches up to 95%. The actuation of cutting tool can be 
automatically stopped as the penetration happens. In addition, 
the proposed system can also be applied to other bone cutting
operations like craniotomy or orthognathic.

All the code are available in Matlab.
